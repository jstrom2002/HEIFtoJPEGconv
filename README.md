### About  
This project was written quickly to convert some files created from an iPhone with a camera accidentally set to 'Live' mode, which produces .heic files. Upon opening them on a Windows PC, Microsoft displays a prompt asking for $1.25 for to download a decoder for viewing the files (which may or may not work for most users, anyway).
